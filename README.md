## About The Project
This is for the *final project* of **Exploratory Text Analysis** course.
I am currently browsing different dataset to specify my analysis topics, and details will be updated & recorded on this readme file and via jupyter notebook on this repository.

* Progress (March 27th)
  * Checking datasets
    * Music lyrics that seems interesting
    * Movie scripts that has sequels & has reviews (sequel is better vs sequel is worse)
     * Dune 1 & 2?
  * specifying topics
    * Comparing movie scripts vs original book
      * use topic models and see how the storyline or perspective changed when movies were scripted based on the book
    * Analyze how topics change as the movie progresses
    * Compare movies that have sequels
      * i.e., Dune 1 vs Dune 2 -> what difference in the topics of each movie? what kind of components are there that is different between the two movies -> based on the reviews, which factors from the analyzed part link to the change in reviews?
      * topic models? sentiment analysis? ~~

* Final (TBD)
  * result images
  * demo link
